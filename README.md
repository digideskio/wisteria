# Wisteria [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/t32k/wisteria.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/t32k/wisteria) [![wercker status](https://app.wercker.com/status/fff7cc4c5446d5b16065e8f93a79309e/s/master "wercker status")](https://app.wercker.com/project/bykey/fff7cc4c5446d5b16065e8f93a79309e)

Wisteria.css is a class selectors based harmless CSS library.

+ __Harmless__: Wisteria dose not destroy your web page style, because has only class selectors. [HTML5-Reset](https://github.com/murtaugh/HTML5-Reset) just reset the style.
+ __Helper__: Wisteria has a bunch of [Emmet](http://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/)-like utility classes. It means you do not have to learn the namig rules.
+ __Hi-Control__: Wisteria's grid implements simple and modern [Flexbox](http://philipwalton.github.io/solved-by-flexbox/demos/grids/) layout, so you make a mockup site with less typing rapidly.
